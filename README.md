## CALCULATOR FOR BASIC ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS :

This is a web API developed by using the Flask framework in Python, it will take the input from the user and perform the selected arithmetic operation
on it.

I have defined two different methods for the Data input:

One is the simple form-based, which will ask for input, calculate, and show the result page.

The second one is by using the Postman application, we can put the JSON file after the URL into that.

The API is developed using the Flask framework and their post method for the input data and the frontend is designed using HTML and CSS.
